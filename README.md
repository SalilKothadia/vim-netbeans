VIM-Netbeans
=============

We want use VIM as great as Netbeans for editing PHP, Phyton, JS, HTML, XML and many else filetype.

Now this VIM-Netbeans supported with NodeJS, Stylus, Less and many CSS/Javascript engine, template, parser 

This VIM bundled with many plugins, syntax and custom .vimrc configuration. 

This VIM is inspired by many great developers that share their custom VIM configuration.

All TLDR; documentation located in .vimrc. You can read and follow link there to see related projects used.

Installing
-----------
Go to your Command / Terminal : 

cd ~/

git clone git://github.com/yodiaditya/vim-netbeans.git vim-netbeans

ln -s ~/vim-netbeans/.vim ~/.vim

ln -s ~/vim-netbeans/.vimrc ~/.vimrc


Dependencies
------------

After do installing, you should go to VIM and do :BundleInstall. I use Vundle here which i use pathogen in the past development.

I use nodejs-snipmate and snipmate snippets from honza. So delete /snipmate.vim/snippets for enabling this two snippets update. 


Also, i install Python Debugger like pyflakes, pylint and pep8. 

For installing Python debugger using PIP :

sudo pip install pylint
sudo pip install pyflakes
sudo pip install pep8

Read .vimrc for magic keys and guide.

Also you need Ctags. If you using Ubuntu, then can do this command :

sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags


Usage
------
For using this custom VIM, here are some clue : 

1. Use Backspace as PageUp & Space as PageDown 

2. Use tab in insert mode for autocomplete for Python ( using PyDiction )

3. Text Autocomplete every you type. Also you can use CTRL + Space for Omni Completion

4. Move to another tab / buffer using CTRL+Arrow

5. Using NERDTree by :NERDTree or editing .vimrc to enable NERDTree automatically.

6. Use :e to create buffer instead using :tabe because it will conflicting with miniBufExplorer.
